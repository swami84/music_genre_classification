# Music Genre Classification

## Introduction

Human can identify genre by listening to the song very shortly. While most of us can converge on our genre identification for a given song/music but it becomes hard to explain on how we came to the conclusion. 
The even harder problem is to generalize and translate it to a machine-ready algorithm. Here I take an effort to classify top genres as listed on last.fm website by training 2 models - using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Convolution Recurrent Neural Network(CRNN) models.

## Data

Top 100 songs for each genre (total 17) were scraped from [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music)
